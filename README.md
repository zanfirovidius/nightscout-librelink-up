# Nightscout LibreLink Up Uploader/Sidecar
Simple Script written in JavaScript (Node) that uploads CGM readings from LibreLink Up to Nightscout. The upload happens every minute and should work with at least Freestyle Libre 2 and Libre 3 CGM sensors.

## Usage
There are different options for using this script.

### Variant 1: On Heroku

- Click [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/timoschlueter/nightscout-librelink-up)
- Login to Heroku if not already happened
- Provide proper values for the `environment variables`
- **Important: make sure that yor Nightscout API token is hashed with SHA1**
- Click `Deploy` to deploy the app

### Variant 2: Local

The installation process can be startetd by running `npm install` in the root directory.

To start the process simply create a bash script with the set environment variables (`start.sh`):

```
#!/bin/bash
export LINK_UP_USERNAME="mail@example.com"
export LINK_UP_PASSWORD="mypassword"
export NIGHTSCOUT_URL="nightscout.yourdomain.com"
# use `shasum` instead of `sha1sum` on Mac
export NIGHTSCOUT_API_TOKEN=$(echo -n "foo-bar-baz" | sha1sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

npm start
```

Execute the script and check the console output.

### Variant 3: Docker
The easiest way to use this is to use the latest docker image:

```
docker run -e LINK_UP_USERNAME="mail@example.com" \
            -e LINK_UP_PASSWORD="mypassword" \
            -e NIGHTSCOUT_URL="nightscout.yourdomain.com" \
            -e NIGHTSCOUT_API_TOKEN="librelinku-123456789abcde" timoschlueter/nightscout-librelink-up
```

### Variant 4: Docker Compose
If you are already using a dockerized Nightscout instance, this image can be easily added to your existing docker-compose file:

```
version: '3.7'

services:
  nightscout-libre-link:
    image: timoschlueter/nightscout-librelink-up
    container_name: nightscout-libre-link
    environment:
      LINK_UP_USERNAME: "mail@example.com"
      LINK_UP_PASSWORD: "mypassword"
      NIGHTSCOUT_URL: "nightscout.yourdomain.com"
      NIGHTSCOUT_API_TOKEN: "librelinku-123456789abcde"
```

## ToDo
- **Integration into Nightscout**: I have not yet looked into the plugin architecture of Nightscout. Maybe this should be converted into a plugin.
